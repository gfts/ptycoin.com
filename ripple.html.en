      <p>Since it's inception, PTYcoin has always placed a high priority on the privacy of our customers. We collect only the
         minimum amount of information necessary to do business with our clients and remain in compliance with Panamanian
         Anti Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations. Ripple Labs has recently implemented new policies
         which would require PTYcoin to collect and share far more information about our customers than we are comfortable with.
         So we have made the decision NOT to support the use of Ripple. We no longer provide Gateway or Exchange services on
         the Ripple platform. We can however buy and sell Bitcoin to our customers which they can, at their own discression, 
         convert into Ripple and use within the Ripple network through various compliant Ripple gateways that still exist.</p>
