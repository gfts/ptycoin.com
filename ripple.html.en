      <hr/>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>PTYcoin is currently testing our new Ripple Gateway and Exchange service. Using this service, you will be able to 
         trade Bitcoin for US Dollars with other members of the Panama Bitcoin community, and be among the first to establish
         a true exchange rate for Bitcoin in Panama. During our test phase, you will be able to deposit and withdraw USD and
         BTC with Panama Bitcoins, and trade on our exchange with ZERO transfer fees. Keep reading for more details.</p>

      <h2>How do I get started?</h2>
      <hr/>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>To get started, all you need is an activated Ripple account. If you don't have an account, you can sign up for free at
         <a href="https://rippletrade.com">https://rippletrade.com</a>. If you haven't yet activated your account, don't worry,
         we'll activate it for you when you make your first deposit with us.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>Once you've signed up, you can add us to your contacts. Our Ripple address is <strong>~ptycoin</strong>. You should also
         add a trust limit for us (through the settings gear menu) in any amount you feel comfortable with. This should be at
         least as large as any amount you plan to hold on deposit with us in the future. If you're planning on trading between USD
         and BTC, you will need to trust us with both currencies. This is analogous to holding Bitcoin or USD on one of the major
         exchanges. You are trusting them to hold your money for you until you decide to withdraw it. The only difference is that
         in Ripple, you have to specify a limit to your trust. Don't worry about starting out too small. You can edit your trust limits
         in the future if you need to increase them.</p>

      <h2>How do I deposit Bitcoin?</h2>
      <hr/>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>There are three simple ways to deposit Bitcoin to your account. The first is to contact us at <a href="mailto:exchange@ptycoin.com">
         exchange@ptycoin.com</a> letting us know you'd like to make a BTC deposit to the Ripple exchange, and providing your Ripple address.
         We'll give you a Bitcoin address to send the funds to. Once you've sent the funds, we'll credit your Ripple account after 3
         confirmations. During the test phase, if you send us 5 BTC, we will credit you with 5 BTC. We will not be charging a fee for
         deposits or withdraws.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>The second method is to meet with us in person, either at the Bitcoin Embassy we host on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at the New
         York Bagel Cafe on Via Argentina in El Cangrejo between 8am - 2pm, or by contacting us and making arrangements to meet up elsewhere.
         You'll be able to send to our Bitcoin address, and we'll credit your Ripple account after 1 confirmation.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>Finally, we also accept SnapSwap BTC and Bitstamp BTC. If you send Bitstamp BTC or SnapSwap BTC to ~ptycoin, we will send back 
         an equal amount of PTYcoin BTC.</p>

         exchange@ptycoin.com</a> letting us know you'd like to make a USD deposit to the Ripple exchange, and providing your Ripple address.
         We'll give you a bank account to deposit the funds to. You can either deposit in cash at the branch or transfer funds via ACH. Once 
         you've sent the funds, send us a photo or copy of the deposit receipt. Once we've confirmed that funds are available, we'll credit 
         your Ripple account. During the test phase, if you send us $500 USD, we will credit you with $500 USD. We will not be charging a 
         fee for deposits or withdraws.</p>

      <p>The second method is to meet with us in person, either at the Bitcoin Embassy we host on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at the New

         We can accept USD cash, and we'll credit your Ripple account immediately.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>Finally, we also accept SnapSwap USD and Bitstamp USD, with a 3% deposit fee. This is due to the costs associated with withdrawing
         physical USD from SnapSwap and Bitstamp and moving those funds to Panama. If you send Bitstamp USD or SnapSwap USD to ~ptycoin,
         we will send back PTYcoin USD less 3%.</p>

      <h2>How do I place a trade?</h2>
      <hr/>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>To place a trade on the PTYcoin exchange, you will need to go to the Exchange -> Trade tab on your Ripple wallet. You can set
         the currency pair to BTC/USD, and change the issuers for both base and counter currencies to <strong>~ptycoin</strong>. Once
         complete, you'll be able to see our order book, and place limit orders using your available BTC or USD balances. If there are
         any matching orders, your order will be filled immediately, and your balance will be updated. If not, your order will remain
         open until someone enters a matching order, or until you cancel it. Please note that during this testing phase, we do not
         expect a lot of activity, so orders may remain open for some time. We will remain in the test phase of our operations until
         there is sufficient liquidity in the new market to handle our existing volume.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>It is also possible, although probably not advisable until there is more liquidity in the market, to place a market order, 
         using the Exchange -> Convert tab.</p>

      <h2>How do I withdraw USD?</h2>
      <hr/>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>There are two ways to initiate a USD withdraw. If you would prefer an ACH or cash deposit to your Panama
         bank account, send an email to <a href="mailto:exchange@ptycoin.com">exchange@ptycoin.com</a> letting us know your Ripple
         address, and the details of your bank account (Bank, Account Type, Account Number, Name on the Account). Then use the 
         Send tab on your Ripple wallet to send USD to <strong>~ptycoin</strong>. When we see the transfer, we will initiate the
         corresponding transfer from our bank account or cash reserves to your account. As soon as we have made the transfer, we
         will email you with a copy of the deposit slip or ACH confirmation.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>If you need to make a cash withdraw, please let us know at <a href="mailto:exchange@ptycoin.com">exchange@ptycoin.com</a>.
         Depending on the size of the withdraw, and the size of our cash reserve, it may take several days to get sufficient cash
         withdrawn from the bank. This is due to withdraw limits the bank has placed on our account.  We are actively working on 
         ways to eliminate these limits, and we'll update this page at that time. In the mean time, we'll do our best to keep a 
         sufficiently large cash reserve so that this will not be a problem.  Once we have cash in hand to fullfil your withdraw,
         we will notify you so that we can meet up and make the trade.</p>

      <h2>Can I still buy or sell Bitcoin through PTYcoin without using Ripple?</h2>
      <hr/>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>It has always been our goal to provide some sort of feature complete Bitcoin exchange to the Panama market. This Ripple
         exchange is our first attempt at making that goal a reality.  However, while we are in the test phase, you will still 
         be able to purchase or sell your Bitcoin the way we've always done it. Only if this test is successful, do we intend to 
         move the rest of our business onto it, and make it the default method of buying or selling Bitcoin through PTYcoin. On
         the other hand, if the test is unsuccessful, we will resume doing things the way we have been until we find a better
         exchange platform that will be more widely accepted by our users.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>If you use our traditional service for buying or selling Bitcoin, we will continue to use the Bitfinex pricing +/- 1% (or 3%
         in the event we need to buy from a liquidity supplier). There may at times be a significant spread between our Ripple 
         Exchange order book and the Bitfinex order book. You are free to arbitrage between the two services, but we will not offer 
         the "cheaper of the two" prices to buyers or sellers who do not wish to use the Ripple Exchange.</p>
