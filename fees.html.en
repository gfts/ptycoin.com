      <p>PTYcoin has recently implemented a new system of variable fees. As a buyer or seller of bitcoin, the fee you pay will depend on how fast you want to receive your BTC or USD. We do this because the Bitcoin market in Panama is still very small and sometimes we have to go to a liquidity provider so that we can fill an order within a reasonable time. Liquidity suppliers charge us a premium price, so we unfortunately have to pass that expense to our customers. But not everyone is in a hurry to receive their BTC or USD, and so these individuals give us the ability to trade bitcoin at a reduced cost, within the local market. As the market for buying and selling bitcoin in Panama grows, we will depend less and less on liquidity providers, and our ability to deliver bitcoin quickly with a lower fee will improve. Until then, here are our fees:</p>

          <td class="fixed visible">1%</td>
          <td class="fluid visible">You will receive BTC at the market price + 1% as soon as it becomes available, and in the order that your payment was received, once all higher priority USD2BTC transactions have been filled. These transactions will never go to a liquidity provider.</td>
          <td class="fluid visible">You will receive USD at the quoted exchange rate - 1% as soon as it becomes available, and in the order that your BTC was received, once all higher priority BTC2USD transactions have been filled. These transactions will never go to a liquidity provider.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="fixed visible">Medium</td>
          <td class="fixed visible">2%</td>
          <td class="fluid visible">You will receive BTC at the market price + 2% as soon as it becomes available, and in the order that your payment was received, once all higher priority USD2BTC transactions have been filled. These transactions will never go to a liquidity provider.</td>
          <td class="fluid visible">You will receive USD at the quoted exchange rate - 1% as soon as it becomes available, and in the order that your BTC was received, once all higher priority BTC2USD transactions have been filled. These transactions will never go to a liquidity provider.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="fixed visible">High</td>
          <td class="fixed visible">3%</td>
          <td class="fluid visible">You will receive BTC at the market price + 3% within 1 business day. These transactions will go to a liquidity provider if they cannot be filled immediately.</td>
          <td class="fluid visible">You will receive USD at the quoted exchange rate - 3% as soon as it becomes available and in the order that your BTC was received, prior to all lower priority transactions. These transactions will go to a liquidity provider within 1 business day if they cannot be filled immediately, however due to the time it takes to transfer USD between banks or internationally, please allow some time for delivery.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <br/>
      <p style="font-weight: bold;">Please note that face-to-face cash transactions, because of the expectation of instant delivery, are priced as high priority transactions and are subject to availability of funds. These types of transactions cannot easily be sent to a liquidity provider.</p>
